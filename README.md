# deep-learning-challenge
In this challenge, machine learning and neural networks knowledge will be applied to predict the likelihood of success for applicants if they are funded by Alphabet Soup, using the dataset provided.

# Process
**I. Part 1:** Executed Steps 1-3 first in Google Colab and downloaded the file in .ipynb format.

* Step 1: Preprocess the Data
* Step 2: Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model
* Step 3: Optimize the Model

**II. Part 2:** For Step 3, made copies of Part 1 file to Google Colab and Jupyter Notebook. Once Step 3 was done, worked on Steps 4 & 5 to complete the assignment.
